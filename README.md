# TDA7265 100 watt DUAL IC BT Amplifier 

This is a BT amp which has a max ouput of 100watt (50+50) and BT input for audio

# Parts
- TDA7265 IC x2
- MH-M18
- 12-0-12 Transformer

# Plan
I always wanted to make a powerful enough speakers to use with my Sony speaker. Now i have found a appropriate ic which can be tweaked to to get a max output of 50 watt in each channel hence 100watt total TDP.

I have use a MH-M18 BT module which is both cheap and provides lossless audio

i had made a TDA7269A amp which was a 14+14 watt Amp so this is a massive upgrade to it.
